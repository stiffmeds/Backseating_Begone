# Backseating Begone

Disable emotes on cards, emotes that target enemies, and emotes that target allies.

Other players do not need this mod - it disables the emotes as they are received by you.

## Installation

Install [BepInEx](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_AcrossTheObelisk/).

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/stiffmeds/Backseating_Begone/releases) and put it in your BepInEx _plugins_ folder.

Change settings in BepInEx\config\com.meds.backseatingbegone.cfg (appears after first run) OR use a configuration manager (I use [this one - you want the Mono version](https://github.com/sinai-dev/BepInExConfigManager)) to set them ingame. If you use a config manager you need to change BepInEx\config\BepInEx.cfg: HideManagerGameObject = true.
